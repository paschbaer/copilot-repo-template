summary: Interactive Product-to-Feature refinement and controlled Spec-Kit handoff without manual stage-prompt copying.
description: Interactive Product-to-Feature refinement and controlled Spec-Kit handoff — drives all refinement stages (Product → Epic → Capability → Feature Candidate) and the Spec-Kit feature handoff automatically, with iterative generate/audit/revise cycles, persistent findings, and automatic approval only after zero open blocking findings.

# Guidance Product Refinement

## Default Entry Point

Use `references/initial-workflow-prompt.md`. It discovers available inputs, asks one grouped questionnaire for missing blocking values, and then drives all refinement or handoff stages automatically.

## Supported Workflows

- Product → Epic Set
- Epic → Capability Set
- Capability → Feature Candidate Set
- approved Feature Candidate → Spec-Kit Feature Specification

## Mandatory Behavior

- Complete Child Sets, not isolated children
- Iterative generate/audit/revise cycles
- Automatic approval only with zero open blocking findings and completed deterministic checks
- Persistent findings and revision history
- English repository artifacts
- Managed writes only inside the specification subrepository
- No manual copying of internal stage prompts

## Resources

- `references/initial-workflow-prompt.md`: operator entry point
- `references/stage-contracts.md`: normative internal stage behavior
- `docs/user-guide-en.md`: English user guide
- `templates/run-manifest.yaml`, `findings.yaml`, `approval.yaml`: persistence templates
